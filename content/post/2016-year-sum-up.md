* Most interesting/inspiring people I met this year:
    * Ashik Salahudeen: He knows 8 programming languages and expert in a lot of areas in IT. I asked him - how do you achieve that? He told that usually he was hired to solve some complex problem and after he solves that complex problem - he moved to another company to solve next complex problem. He usually change company every 2 years. So He learns a lot and constantly has a challenge. Also - he reads techincal books :) He told it allows to grasp some technology much faster, because good books often have distilled experience about some technology, so you can save a lot of learning time by reading them.
